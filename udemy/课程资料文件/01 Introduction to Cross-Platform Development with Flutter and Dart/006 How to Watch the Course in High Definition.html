All these links are collated on one page, so you can find them easily.</p><p>Head over to the link below and <strong>bookmark it</strong>, so whenever I mention something in the course, you'll find it in the course resources.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Flutter-Course-Resources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Course Resources</a></p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Course Changes and Solutions</strong></h4><p>As with all technology-based courses, things are constantly changing. Your software may not look exactly the same as the videos. A student on the course (Jay @DetailedDeveloper) has very kindly started a GitHub repository of all the changes and solutions to common problems encountered in the course. It's worth bookmarking it and refer to it if you find yourself getting stuck. If you are familiar with GitHub, feel free to contribute to the repository and help Jay keep it up to date.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/DetainedDeveloper/App-Brewery-Flutter-Null-Safety" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/DetainedDeveloper/App-Brewery-Flutter-Null-Safety</a></p><p><br></p><h4><strong>How to Watch the Course in HD</strong></h4><p>All the lessons are recorded and uploaded in 1080p HD video format. If you find your videos blurry then you can change the quality by going to the gear icon at the bottom right and select the highest definition you see. Udemy's video player is coded up quite strangely, sometimes it won't show you the 1080p option because it thinks your internet is too slow. In this case be sure to click on the "Report technical issue" in the same menu and get the Udemy support team to help you.</p><figure><img src="https://i.ibb.co/LgPGcLT/2020-01-16-10-45-28-72809ef556c366a7e252fe243e35ae00.png"></figure><h4><strong>How to Download the Course for Offline Viewing</strong></h4><p>You can download all the lessons in the course to watch offline by getting the Udemy app for iOS or Android.
